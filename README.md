# ServerlessWebApplication
<h2>Description:</h2>
This project is a web application that is built using serverless architecture on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. The goal of this project is to leverage AWS services to create a scalable, cost-effective, and highly available web application without the need for managing traditional servers. We are going to build a web app the will give us the result of Base to the power of Exponent.

<h2> Key Components and Services used:</h2>

1. AWS Lambda: AWS Lambda is used to run the application's backend code in a serverless manner. It allows you to execute code in response to events, such as HTTP requests or database updates.

2. Amazon API Gateway: API Gateway is used to create RESTful APIs that act as the entry point for the web application. It handles requests from clients and routes them to the appropriate Lambda functions.

3. Amazon S3: S3 (Simple Storage Service) is used to store static assets of the web application, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and images.

4. Amazon DynamoDB: DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service provided by AWS. It is used to store and retrieve data for the web application. DynamoDB offers scalability, low latency, and automatic scaling.

5. AWS IAM : AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can centrally manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

<h2>Project Workflow:</h2>

1. Design the architecture: Define the components and services required for the web application, including API Gateway, Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, and IAM.

2. To host our Website, we will choose Amplify. With Amplify, we can build and host websites. For our purpose, since our website is very simple we will create an html file in a text editor on our local machine and just use Amplify to deploy and host that webpage. The code for this is given above in the INDEX.HTML ORIGINAL file. Just copy and Paste this code in your file. Once you have created this file, Zip it by just right clicking on the file and selecting compress.

3. On the AWS Console, navigate to AWS Amplify and click on New App. Here, just click on Deploy Without Git Provider, Enter a name for the App and Environment name and Choose and upload the Zip file.

4. We need to create a Lamda Function that will process our math functionality. From AWS Console, navigate to AWS Lamda. Click on New function. We are going to author this from scratch. Enter thr name of thr Function, Runtime as the latest version of Python and click on Create Function.On the main page of Lamda, scroll down to the Code block. The code for this Lamda Function is given in the LamdaFunctionOriginal file above. Just copy and paste the code. Click on Deploy and we are done.

<br />

5. Now, we need something to invoke our Math Functionality. For this, we will use API Gateway. This is a core functionality in AWS which we can use to create our own APIs. In a Serverless Architrcture, it is the perfect way to invoke our Lamda Function. From the AWS Console, navigate to API Gateway and Click on Create API. We are going to use a REST API. Give it a name and click on Create API.

<br />

6. Click on the API created. On the lefthand side, click on Resources. On the righthand side, click on "/". From thr Actions menu, select Create Method. The type of method will be POST. Enter the Lamda Function name and create the POST method as shown below:

<br />

7. Next, we must Enable CORS (Cross Origin Resourse Sharing) so that our website can interact with the lamda function. To do so, click on the POST method and from Actions menu select Enable CORS. Click on Deploy API to deploy and enter the Deployment stage as dev. Copy the Invoke URL and keep it handy. We will be using it later.

<br />

8. Now we need to setup a database to store the results. We will use DynamoDB for this. Navigate to DynamoDB and Click on Create Table. Enter the name and create table. Copy the ARN of this table.

<br />

9. Next, we have to give our Lamda Function the permission to write results to the DynamoDB table. Navigate back to the our Lamda Function and Scroll down to the Configuration section. Click on the execution role and select add inline policy. Name the policy and click on JSON. The code for this policy is given above in the ExecutionRolePolicyJSON file. Copy and paste the code and create the policy. Make sure you enter the ARN of the Table you created in the poilcy.

<br />

10. Navigate to the Code tab of the Lamda Function. We need to make some changes to our code so that the Lamda Function can write the results to the table. It wasn't doing that before. The updated code is given above in the LamdaFunctionFinal file. Copy and paste the code and click on Delopy.

<br />

11. We must update our Index.html file in order to invoke the API from our website. Copy the code from Index.html file above and paste it in your file. Make sure you add your API gateway endpoint.   Compress the file and add it to our Amplify website.

<h2>Benefits of AWS Serverless Web Application:</h2>

- Scalability: The serverless architecture allows the web application to scale automatically based on demand, ensuring optimal performance even during high traffic periods.

- Cost-effectiveness: With serverless, you only pay for the actual usage of resources, eliminating the need for provisioning and managing servers, which can result in cost savings.

- High availability: AWS services, such as Lambda and DynamoDB, are designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant, ensuring the web application remains accessible even in the event of failures.

- Reduced operational overhead: Serverless architecture offloads the operational tasks, such as server management, to AWS, allowing developers to focus more on application development and business logic.
